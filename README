A silly project from 2006 that exists here strictly for posterity.

I made an AOL Instant Messenger bot which would reply to people using Eliza. In
addition to my own Eliza chat script, if the bot didn't know what to say, it
would respond by entering the incoming message into Ask Jeeves -- which, at the
time, had particularly bad search quality -- and would reply with one of Ask
Jeeve's "Related Searches" chosen at random. This led to amusing exchanges like:

  xxx: hey you wanna hang out? all my regular dudes are out of the city
  bot: How do you feel about all of your regular dudes are out of the city?
  xxx: its tuesday
  bot: You're a muppet!

People started to have really long conversations with the bot thinking it was me
so later on I added a feature so that after 15 messages or so it would reveal
that it was a robot.
